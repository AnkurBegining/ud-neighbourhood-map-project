# ud-neighbourhood-map-project

This is mine 4th project of full stack nanodegree Udacity. It is one of the finest project that i worked using js. This is 
near neighbourhood map.

I have developed a single page application featuring a map of mine neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit.
I live in state known for spirituality, so i decided to create for temples which are near to me. For now i have developed for all the most visited temple of my town. I have then add functionality to this map including 
highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content. I have provided filter
option for filtering the name of our temple.
